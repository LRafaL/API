# API Testing

This section is dedicated to practical work on API testing.
I created a collection of REST requests in Postman for testing the API of the web application [demoshopping.ru]( https://demoshopping.ru/), using variables, request chaining, automated tests for verifying responses, and data generation for requests. Then I created test cases for these requests.
I also created a collection of requests for testing the API using the SOAP protocol for a service that allows retrieving information about a target country.
